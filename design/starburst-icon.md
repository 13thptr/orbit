The "canonical" starburst used as the app icon is currently taken from the Starburst Sandbox in the UI Storybook. Probably we'll want to tune it by hand at some point, but this'll do for now. The settings:

Line count: 18
Random seed: seed111111111111111111111111
Line min: 0.25
Liune max: 0.95
Size: 120
Use composition: yes
Color palette index: 0
All colors: black
Extra rotation degrees: 10
Scale: 1.0
Translate X/Y: 0
Thickness: 4

Then I copy/paste the SVG into Figma, matte it, and export.
